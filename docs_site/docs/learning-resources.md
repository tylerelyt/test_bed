## 📖 Learning Tips & Best Practices

### Reading Strategy

1. **Start with Summaries**
   - Read blog post summaries or abstracts first
   - Get the main ideas before diving into details
   - Identify key technical terms and concepts

2. **Focus on Technical Terms**
   - Build your AI/ML vocabulary systematically
   - Create a personal glossary of important terms
   - Note how terms are used in different contexts

3. **Practice Reading Regularly**
   - Set aside dedicated time each week (e.g., 30-60 minutes)
   - Aim to read 1-2 articles per week
   - Consistency is more important than volume

4. **Active Reading Techniques**
   - Take notes while reading
   - Highlight important concepts and technical terms
   - Write down questions and areas for further study
   - Summarize key points in your own words

5. **Engage with the Content**
   - Try to implement concepts in your own projects
   - Discuss interesting findings with peers or study groups
   - Write blog posts or notes about what you learned
   - Share insights with your team

### Vocabulary Building

**Key AI/ML Terms to Master**:
- Model training, fine-tuning, inference
- Embeddings, vectors, tokenization
- Prompt engineering, few-shot learning
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)
- Model serving, deployment, scaling
- Observability, monitoring, logging

**Practice Exercises**:
1. After reading an article, write a summary in English
2. Explain key concepts to someone else (in English if possible)
3. Translate technical terms from your native language to English
4. Participate in English-language technical discussions

### Reading Comprehension Tips

1. **Don't worry about understanding everything**
   - Focus on main ideas first
   - Technical details can be revisited later
   - Use context clues to infer meaning

2. **Use tools wisely**
   - Dictionary for unfamiliar words
   - Translation tools for complex sentences (but try to understand first)
   - Technical documentation for clarification

3. **Read multiple sources**
   - Compare how different authors explain the same concept
   - See terminology used in different contexts
   - Build a more complete understanding
